## List of things to fix or add!

1) Scraper throws out a sometimes large amount of posts in getHouses() method. --> Can probably
get the brSqft from somewhere else? FIXED!!! Now it only throws out posts which are unusable

2) Deploy via Flask, where 3 forms are filled out and sent to runAll.py to be run.
