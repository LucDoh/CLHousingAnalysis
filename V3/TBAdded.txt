## List of things to fix or add!

1) Deploy via Flask, where 3 forms are filled out and sent to runAll.py to be run.

2) Output Folium or Bokeh interactive map plot of houses

3) There seem to be an excessive amount of duplicate posts (some posts have
~10-10^2 dupes), this seems to stem from the scraping function helpers.getHouses()
[Result: 1887--> 106 Postings are analyzed in the end]
